# ros2.fish
Integrate ROS2 with the fish-shell, and add interactive goodies to make you robotics workflow a little more fluid.

You may get most of the functionality (and possibly better completion of a command's options) by simply putting `register-python-argcomplete --shell fish ros2 | source ` into your `config.fish`. However, this package has quite a few other advantages, see the list below. You can still add the argcomplete-line into your config, but then the completions may get a bit more crowded.

- Complete message/request/goal type (`ros2 topic pub`, `ros2 service call`, `ros2 action send_goal`) by simply pressing tab after completing the topic/service name
- Complete interface type (`ros2 interface show`, `ros2 interface proto`) or available packages, (`ros2 interface package`) by simply pressing tab after writing the subcommand
- Complete message/request/goal structure (`ros2 topic pub`, `ros2 service call`, `ros2 action send_goal`) with all their fields and default values, making it simple to publish/call complex message/service-request types. Note that fish of version 4.0

  - `rti` to get an interactive display of topics and show their type, number of subscribers/publishers for the selected topic (this requires [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to be installed!)
